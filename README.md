# Monty-Hall-Problem
This Python project simulates the Monty Hall problem to show that switching doors is statistically the best strategy. It runs 100,000 simulations for scenarios with 3, 10, and 10,000 doors, comparing "stay" vs "switch" win rates. Results are visualized using `matplotlib`, and dependencies include `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.
